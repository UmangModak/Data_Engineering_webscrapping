Importing Libraries:

requests: Used to make HTTP requests to fetch data from the provided URLs.
pandas: Mentioned but not used in the current code. Typically used for data manipulation and analysis.
Defining Data Sources:

A dictionary sources holds the names of cities as keys and their respective project URLs as values.
Function Definitions:

extract_data(source_url): This function takes a URL as input, sends an HTTP GET request, and returns the HTML content if the request is successful. If the request fails, it prints an error message.
transform_data(html_content): This function is intended to transform the extracted HTML content into a useful format. Currently, it simply returns the raw HTML content.
load_data(data, filename): This function takes the transformed data and a filename as inputs. It saves the data into a file with the given filename.
Main Execution Block:

The main() function iterates over each source in the sources dictionary. For each source:
It extracts the data from the URL using extract_data().
It transforms the extracted data using transform_data().
It loads the transformed data into an HTML file named after the city using load_data().
Script Execution:

The script is executed by calling the main() function if the script is run as the main program.
Description of the Workflow:
Extract Data:

For each city URL, the script fetches the HTML content of the webpage.
Transform Data:

Currently, the transformation step does not alter the HTML content but returns it as is. In a complete implementation, this step would involve parsing the HTML to extract relevant information (e.g., project names, descriptions, statuses).
Load Data:

The raw (or transformed) HTML content is saved into a file named after the city (e.g., Richmond_data.html).
This ETL process is useful for aggregating project data from multiple city websites into a structured format for further analysis or reporting. To complete the transformation step, you would typically use a library like BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract the specific data points of interest.
